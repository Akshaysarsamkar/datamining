Q1.Write a R program to add, multiply and divide two vectors of integer type. (vector length should 

be minimum 4)

Answer: 

vector1 = seq(10,40 , length.out=4)

vector2 = c(20, 10, 40, 40)

print("Original Vectors:")

print(vector1)

print(vector2)

add= vector1+vector2

cat("Sum of vector is ",add, "\n")

sub_vector= vector1-vector2

cat("Substraction of vector is ",sub_vector, "\n")

mul_vector= vector1 * vector2

cat("Multiplication of vector is ",mul_vector, "\n")

print("Division of two Vectors:")

div_vector = vector1 / vector2

print(div_vector)

Q2. Write a Python program build Decision Tree Classifier for shows.csv from pandas and predict 

class label for show starring a 40 years old American comedian, with 10 years of experience, and a 

comedy ranking of 7? Create a csv file as shown in 

https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_decision_tree.asp

Answer: 

import pandas 

from sklearn import tree

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pandas.read_csv("Age.csv")

d = {'UK': 0, 'USA': 1, 'N': 2}

df['Nationality'] = df['Nationality'].map(d)

d = {'YES': 1, 'NO': 0}

df['Go'] = df['Go'].map(d)

features = ['Age', 'Experience', 'Rank', 'Nationality']

X = df[features]

y = df['Go']

print(X) 

print(y)
